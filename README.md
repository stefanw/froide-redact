# Redaction in the browser

How it works:

1. PDF is converted to HTML with [html2pdfEx](https://coolwanglu.github.io/pdf2htmlEX/)
2. HTML is loaded in the browser and redacted in the browser
3. Serialized redaction operations (text selections, image black outs) are sent to the server
4. Server loads HTML into [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/), applies redaction operations and either returns the redacted HTML or prints page back to PDF


## Installation

### On your machine

Install [html2pdfEx](https://coolwanglu.github.io/pdf2htmlEX/) and [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/).

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python manage.py runserver

Then visit:
<http://localhost:8000/?url=http://localhost:8000/static/example.pdf>


### Using docker

    docker build -t froide_redact .
    docker run -p 8000:8000 -i -t froide_redact

Then visit:
<http://localdocker:8000/?url=http://localdocker:8000/static/example.pdf>


## Usage

The links to the bottom open a sample pdf rendered as html.

- Select parts of the text to redact that part
- Click on links to remove the links (probably doesn't work yet)
- Draw rectangles on images to make a redact them

Click one of the redact buttons at the top and get back either HTML or PDF. HTML may work better.
